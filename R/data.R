#' 1D elevation proile near Mt Denali.
#'
#' This is a 1D, west-east elevation profile south of Mt McKinley
#' (or Denali). It can be used as synthetic 1D data.
#'
#' The profile is south of Mt McKinley.
#' I avoided Mt McKinley because it would create a dominant peak,
#' making the profile less interesting.
#' The elevation data were downloaded from the National Map Seamless
#' Server, \url{http://seamless.usgs.gov},
#' National Elevation Dataset Alaska (NED) 2 Arc Second,
#' in `Grid Float' format, and read in using function \code{gridfloat}.
